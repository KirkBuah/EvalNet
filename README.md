This is the official implementation of [EvalNet: A Practical Toolchain for Generation and Analysis of Extreme-Scale Interconnects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.12663).

EvalNet is a toolchain for scalable generation and analysis over 25 important network topologies, such as Slim Fly, PolarFly, and Orthogonal Fat Trees, with a strong focus on path diversity metrics.
EvalNet provides an extensive and fine-grained analysis of shortest and non-shortest paths, including their multiplicities, lengths, and interference.


## Setup Guide

In order to use this framework, you need to have a working installation of Python 3.9 or newer.


### Installing EvalNet

Before running the installation, make sure to activate your Python environment (if any) beforehand.

```
git clone https://github.com/spcl/EvalNet.git
cd EvalNet
pip install .
apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
cd analysis
make
```
Our analysis code depends on libsqlite3, so please install its development files (header, static libraries) via your distributions packet manager.
If necessary, please update the C compiler (default: gcc) before compiling the source code in the `analysis` directory.


## Usage

We have integrated all currently supported functionality into a single tool.

```
python3 tool.py -h
usage: tool.py [-h] {generate,validate,clean,info,analyse,plot,show,ggplot,ggplot2} ...

positional arguments:
  {generate,validate,clean,info,analyse,plot,show,ggplot,ggplot2}
                        type of operation
    generate            generates a topology
    validate            validates a topology
    clean               removes generated topologies
    info                saves information about selected topologies
    analyse             analysing tool
    plot                plotting tool
    show                Execute a SQL query and show the results.
    ggplot              Execute a SQL query and plot results using python-ggplot. Uses matplotlib, pandas and the ggplot package.
    ggplot2             Execute a SQL query and plot results using R ggplot2. Requires sqldf and ggplot2 for R.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```
Specifically the tool supports the generation of new topologies (more in [topogen/README.md](topogen/README.md)), the analysis of already generated topologies as well as plotting the analyzed metrics (more in [analysis/README.md](analysis/README.md)).


## Supported Topologies

The output of the generated topologies is stored in the respective topology directory of the `data` directory.

## Supported Measures

EvalNet supports the following measures:
- shortest path length
- shortest path multiplicity
- count of edge disjoint paths
- path interference

The analyze part of the tool comes with the following command line interface:
```
usage: tool.py analyse [-h] {shortestpaths,disjointpaths,interference} ...

positional arguments:
  {shortestpaths,disjointpaths,interference}
                        type of analysis

    disjointpaths       analyses disjoint paths
    interference        analyses interference

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
```
We document the supported parameters for each measure in [analysis/README.md](analysis/README.md#measures).

Multiple topologies as well as the topologies classes, i.e. the number of nodes in the network, can be specified.
The output of the analysis is stored in `data/analysis/{analysis type}.db`.

EvalNet supports the following visualizations:
- histogram of shortest path length
- histogram of shortest path multiplicity
